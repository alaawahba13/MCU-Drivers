# STM32 Drivers

This repository contains a collection of drivers for STM32 microcontrollers. The drivers are designed to work with the STM32CubeIDE development environment and have been tested on a variety of STM32 boards, including the STM32F4-Discovery and the Nucleo-F401RE.

## Getting Started

To use these drivers in your project, simply clone this repository into your STM32CubeIDE project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alaawahba13/MCU-Drivers.git
```

Then add the appropriate driver files to your project by including them in your build system. The drivers are organized by peripheral and can be found in the `drivers` directory.

## Documentation

Documentation for each driver is provided in the form of header files and comments within the source code. The drivers are designed to be easily customizable and configurable for specific applications.
